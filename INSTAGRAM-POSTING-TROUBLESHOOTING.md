# Instagram Posting Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue
Posts successfully trigger from Slack ‚Üí Zapier shows success ‚Üí Instagram rejects posts silently

## Most Likely Root Causes (in order of probability)

### 1. Instagram Business Account Connection Issue ‚≠ê MOST LIKELY

**Problem**: Your Zapier app may not have proper permissions to your Instagram Business account.

**Fix**:
1. Go to Zapier ‚Üí My Apps ‚Üí Instagram for Business
2. Click "Reconnect"
3. During reconnection, ensure you:
   - Select the correct Facebook Business Page
   - Select the correct Instagram Business Account (not Personal/Creator)
   - Grant ALL requested permissions
4. After reconnecting, go back to your Zap
5. Click on the Instagram step ‚Üí Refresh fields
6. Re-select your Instagram account from the dropdown

**Verify**: Your Instagram account should show the page name, not just an ID

---

### 2. Image URL Accessibility

**Problem**: Instagram's image fetcher cannot download images from Unsplash URLs

**Current Image URLs**: All posts use `images.unsplash.com` with parameters
```
https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1569529465841-dfecdab7503b?w=1080&q=80
```

**Test**: Check if Instagram can access these URLs
- Unsplash may block Instagram's user agent
- CDN rate limiting may prevent Instagram from downloading

**Fix Option A - Use Direct Upload**:
1. In your Zap, add a step between Slack and Instagram:
   - **App**: Code by Zapier (Python)
   - **Action**: Download image from Unsplash URL and return as file

```python
import requests
import base64

# Get the image URL from Slack attachments
image_url = input_data['attachments_image_url']

# Download the image
response = requests.get(image_url)
image_data = base64.b64encode(response.content).decode()

# Return as file
return {
    'file': f'data:image/jpeg;base64,{image_data}',
    'filename': 'post_image.jpg'
}
```

2. In Instagram step, use the output from Code step as Media instead of URL

**Fix Option B - Host Images on Cloudflare R2/AWS S3**:
1. Upload images to your own CDN (Cloudflare R2 has 10GB free)
2. Use those URLs instead of Unsplash
3. Ensures Instagram can always access images

### 3. Instagram Account Type Issue

**Problem**: Account must be Instagram Business or Creator account

**Check**:
1. Open Instagram app on phone
2. Go to your profile (legacywineandliquor)
3. Tap hamburger menu ‚Üí Settings and privacy ‚Üí Account type and tools
4. Should say "Business account" or "Creator account"

**If it says Personal Account**:
1. Settings ‚Üí Account type and tools ‚Üí Switch to professional account
2. Choose "Business"
3. Select category: "Wine, Beer & Spirits Store"
4. Connect to your Facebook Business Page

---

### 4. Facebook Page Connection

**Problem**: Instagram Business account not properly linked to Facebook Page

**Fix**:
1. Go to Facebook Business Manager (business.facebook.com)
2. Navigate to Business Settings ‚Üí Accounts ‚Üí Instagram Accounts
3. Verify your Instagram account is listed and connected
4. Click on your Instagram account ‚Üí Should show "Connected to Facebook Page: Legacy Wine & Liquor"
5. If not connected:
   - Click "Add" ‚Üí Add Instagram Account
   - Enter your Instagram login
   - Select the Facebook Page to connect

---

### 5. API Permissions Issue

**Problem**: Zapier doesn't have `instagram_content_publish` permission

**Fix**:
1. Go to Facebook Business Manager ‚Üí Business Settings
2. Navigate to System Users
3. Find or create a system user for Zapier
4. Grant permissions:
   - ‚úÖ instagram_basic
   - ‚úÖ instagram_content_publish
   - ‚úÖ pages_read_engagement
   - ‚úÖ pages_manage_posts
5. Save changes
6. Reconnect Zapier to Instagram (see Fix #1)

---

### 6. Caption Issues

**Current Captions**: All posts have:
- Emojis (ü•É, üåü, üìç)
- Hashtags (~10 per post, well under 30 limit)
- Line breaks
- Special characters

**Potential Issues**:
- Some emojis may not be supported
- Caption length over 2,200 characters (unlikely with your posts)

**Test with Minimal Caption**:
Create a test post with:
```
Test post from Zapier automation. #LegacyWine #Test
```

If this works but your regular posts don't, the issue is caption formatting.

### 7. Image Specifications

**Instagram Requirements**:
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Minimum: 320 x 320 pixels
- Maximum: 8 MB file size
- Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square), 4:5 (portrait), 1.91:1 (landscape)

**Your Unsplash Images**:
- Using `?w=1080&q=80` parameters
- Should be compliant, but verify with:

```bash
curl -s "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1569529465841-dfecdab7503b?w=1080&q=80" | file -
```
